# Disease Prediction
## Introduction

This repository hosts a machine learning project focused on disease prediction based on textual descriptions of patients' symptoms. The primary objective of this project is to accurately identify diseases by analyzing symptoms provided in text form. Disease prediction has significant applications in healthcare, particularly in early diagnosis and personalized medicine, where timely and accurate identification of conditions can lead to better treatment outcomes.
Project Overview

In this project, we leverage natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to process and analyze patient symptoms. The model is trained on a dataset containing various symptoms and corresponding diseases, enabling it to predict potential diseases based on new symptom descriptions.
Key Features

    Symptom Analysis: The system takes in text-based symptom descriptions and processes them using NLP techniques to extract relevant features.
    Machine Learning Model: A trained machine learning model predicts the most likely disease based on the input symptoms.
    Scalability: The model can be adapted to include more diseases and symptoms as new data becomes available.

Applications

    Early Diagnosis: Assisting healthcare professionals by providing preliminary disease predictions based on patient symptoms.
    Personalized Medicine: Enhancing treatment plans by offering predictions tailored to individual patient conditions.

Installation

To run this project locally, you need to install the required dependencies. You can do this by running:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

After installing the dependencies, you can start the application by executing the main script. The application will prompt you to enter symptoms, and it will return the predicted disease.

bash

streamlit run app.py

Technologies Used

    Streamlit: For building the web interface.
    TensorFlow: For training and deploying the machine learning model.
    BeautifulSoup: For text processing and cleaning.
    NumPy: For numerical operations.
    Keras: High-level neural networks API used with TensorFlow.
    Joblib: For saving and loading machine learning models.
    NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): For stemming and other NLP tasks.
